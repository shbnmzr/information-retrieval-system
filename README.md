# Information Retrieval System

## Introduction
This is lightweight Python-based information retrieval system that attempts to address an *ad hoc retrieval* task, in which a system provides documents from within a collection that are relevant to an arbitrary *information need*, communicated by means of a one-off user-initiated *query*.

The project supports document indexing, query processing, and result ranking on a simple corpus. 
It is designed for educational purposes and is extensible for experimentation.
